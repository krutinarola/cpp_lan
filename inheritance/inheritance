Types Of Inheritance:-
    1.Single inheritance
    2.Multilevel inheritance
    3.Multiple inheritance
    4.Hierarchical inheritance
    5.Hybrid inheritance

[1. Single Inheritance:]-> 
       ~> In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class.
       ~> i.e. one subclass is inherited by one base class only.

Single inheritance in C++

(Syntax:) 

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class
{
  // body of subclass
};
OR
class A
{ 
... .. ... 
};
class B: public A
{
... .. ...
};

2. Multiple Inheritance:
     Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one class.
      i.e one subclass is inherited from more than one base class.

Multiple inheritance in C++

Syntax: 

class subclass_name : access_mode base_class1, access_mode base_class2, ....
{
  // body of subclass
};
class B
{ 
... .. ... 
};
class C
{
... .. ...
};
class A: public B, public C
{
... ... ...
};
Here, the number of base classes will be separated by a comma (',') and the access mode for every base class must be specified. 

3. Multilevel Inheritance:
         In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class.

Multilevel Inheritance in C++

Syntax:-

class C
{ 
... .. ... 
};
class B:public C
{
... .. ...
};
class A: public B
{
... ... ...
};

4. Hierarchical Inheritance: 
    In this type of inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. 
    i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class.

Hierarchical Inheritance in C++

Syntax:-

class A  
{  
    // body of the class A.  
}    
class B : public A   
{  
    // body of class B.  
}  
class C : public A  
{  
    // body of class C.  
}   
class D : public A  
{  
    // body of class D.  
}   

5. Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:
 Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance. 
 For example: Combining Hierarchical inheritance and Multiple Inheritance. 
Below image shows the combination of hierarchical and multiple inheritances:
